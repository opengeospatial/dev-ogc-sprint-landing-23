- var about = "A Code Sprint is an event where dozens of developers from around the world come together to code and share their ideas. The main goals of this code sprint are to support the development of open standards for geospatial information and to support the development of free and open source software which implements those standards, as well as creating awareness about the standards and software projects. This code sprint will take place at Centro Tecnológico Gil Eanes - Universidade de Évora, Casa Cordovil, Rua Dom Augusto Eduardo Nunes nº7 (Évora, Portugal) and on the OGC's Discord events server. It is organised by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo) and the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) and it is hosted by Universidade de Évora, NaturalGIS and Geobeyond.";
